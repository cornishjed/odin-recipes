    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This isn't really a specific recipe, but rather a simple method that
      allows you to create customized breakfast bars, energy bars, power bars,
      sports bars, or whatever you decide to call them. Pretty much any
      ready-to-eat breakfast grain or cereal can work here, along with all you
      favorite nuts, seeds, and dried fruits. No matter what goes in yours, I
      really do hope you give these a try soon. Enjoy!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Oats</li>
      <li>Rice cereal</li>
      <li>Almonds</li>
      <li>Coconut</li>
      <li>Sugar</li>
      <li>Cocoa powder</li>
      <li>salt</li>
      <li>Maple syrup</li>
      <li>water</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8x8 pan
        with butter and line with parchment paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine rolled oats, puffed brown rice cereal, almonds, coconut, cocoa
        powder, salt, and cayenne in a bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine brown sugar, maple syrup, vegetable oil, and water in a small
        saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Stir, and let the
        mixture boil for 1 minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour sugar mixture over the dry ingredients in the bowl and mix
        thoroughly. Transfer to the prepared pan, and smooth out the top,
        pressing lightly with a spatula.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. While still hot, use a
        spatula to score the pan into 8 portions. Let cool to room temperature
        before breaking into bars. You can also not score, and simply let cool,
        then cut with a knife.
